Overview
This task demonstrates how to interact with the Address Verification API, which verifies the validity of an address by sending a POST request with address details. The request should include the required address fields, such as company, street, city, country, phone, and email. A successful verification returns the address details, while an error response indicates that the address could not be found, often due to missing or incorrect address information.

To use the API, send a POST request to https://api.easypost.com/v2/addresses with your address data and the verify_strict[] query parameter set to delivery. If the address is invalid or incomplete, the API returns a 422 error with the message "Address not found." Ensure that the address is correctly formatted, including all necessary fields, for accurate verification.
